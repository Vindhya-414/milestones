<h3 STYLE ="font-family:arial;color:blue;text-align:left"> Save <big>EARTH</big> </h3><pre>
<p style="font-family:italic;color:darkblack;">Each living being on Earth knows the importance
 of Earth in our lives. Without Earth, we cannot even imagine living. Have you ever thought
 how we would walk if there is no Earth, there will be no water to drink, there will not be
 animals living here, and of course, no cultivation, so no food to eat.<big style="font-family:times new romen;color:blue;">This means to say
 that the life of humans, as well as other living beings, cannot be imagined without Earth</big>.
 
     Life is possible on the planet Earth and its related resources. Can you imagine a life on the
 Earth if resources are not available here. And, the answer comes not at all. The resources like 
 air, sunlight, water, creatures, minerals, and vegetation are integral parts of the Earth.
 But with the increasing level of pollution, these resources are getting affected and either
 humans are destroying or depleting recklessly. If we have not taken a calculative step to 
 save the Earth, it is going to be difficult to establish a sustainable future on the earth.
 Letâ€™s understand why is it so crucial to save the Earth from these things: </p></pre>

 <h3 STYLE ="font-family:arial;color:blue;"> Why Saving <big>EARTH</big> Is Necessary ?</h3><pre>
 <p style="font-family:italic;color:darkblack;">In order to save the earth, we must understand that resources that 
 are provided by earth are limited. However, the majority of us are unaware
 of this fact and we are not judiciously utilizing the resources. In order
 to safeguard the existence of humans, we need to protect the earth and 
 take care of it. All living beings are dependent on the earth for their 
 survival and so we should use the gist of nature in a thoughtful way.

     The increase in pollution and damage caused by humans are
 affecting the earth so rapidly that it is threatening our 
 survival.  Saving earth is not merely the need of the hour
 but much more. The extent of degradation caused by humans is
 becoming irreparable. This is one of the reasons why all the
 resources are getting highly polluted.The change in climate is
 also one of the examples that are caused due to severe pollution.
 Moreover, animals, birds are getting extinct and the worlds
 around us are slowly approaching the end.

     Nothing could be scarier than this.Therefore, saving the earth is
 the primary need and we should make conscious decisions to make 
 the earth a better and sustainable place to live in</big>.
 It is and has been our responsibility to protect the planet that
 we live in but rather we become selfish and do such things that 
 create more pollution in our environment.
 <big style="font-family:times new romen;color:blue;">
  
     As the most evolved species of the environment,
 we should understand that our planet is the only 
 planet that supports life</big>.So when the earth 
 will be in peril, we will not have the option to
 move to another planet for our safety.Hence, it is 
 important to make the most use of what we have right
 now in a sustainable manner.Our approach will not only
 save the earth but our lives as well.Moreover, our
 future generation will be bestowed with a healthy
 environment to live in</p></pre>
